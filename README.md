# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyzing the data behind successful and failed theater Kickstarters to provide recommendations on Louise's campaign. 

Over half of the US Theater Kickstarters in the dataset were successful and almost two-thirds of US Play Kickstarters were successful. Outcomes Based on Launch Date - Theaters shows that theater Kickstarter campaigns have most success when launched in May or June. For a musical in Great Britain, the campaign goal should be less than $4000 and ideally around $2000 since that is in the third quartile for amounts pledged.
